# Lab 8 - There’s an App for That: App Development

# By: Lily Schlaug and Noah Lane  
# Summary
The goal of this lab was to serve as an introduction to block coding and use it to communicate with the Arduino. This was done using MIT App Inventor program. Once the app was designed.

# Materials  
1 x Computer running Arduino IDE  
1 x Computer with MIT App Inventor installed  
1 x Bluetooth HC-05 module 
   
***SparkFun Inventor’s kit:***   
1 x RedBoard  
1 x Ultrasonic sensor  
2 x Motors  
1 x Motor Driver  
2 x wheels  
1 x AA battery pack  
1 x paper clip  
1 x command strip    
# Assembly Procedures
**Part 1**
1. Begin with the circuit from Lab 6
2. Attach the provided wheels to the motors
3. Mount the motors using command strips underneath the Arduino
4. Mount the battery back using command strips under the Arduino
5. Attach paper clip to the back of the plate to prevent the battery from dragging on the ground
